## NotePad

## Project Description

This project is a represenation of my current knowledge of nodejs and utilizing the express node module. Using the Challenge 11 ReadMe and started code as a guide, I connected the front end and back end of the application using the express node module and get/post routes. The application itself is essentially a note taker tool that can save notes once a user enters their title and text and then clicks on the save note button that appears in the top right corner. The server.js file shows the application's back end functionalitly by assigning paths to display html content, creating a process that takes user input and stores it in db.json which is then used to render the content on the page, and the abiilty to view all current entries in db.json by it being displayed on the notes.html page or viewing it in json format by entering http://localhost:{PORT}/api/notes.
